A popular culinary movement, the Terroir Parisien is the result of All\u00e9no\u2019s 10 years of dedicated efforts to save the Parisian agricultural heritage that had been forgotten and drastically reduced as a result of town planning and rural exodus.\n\nAs a consequence of this major involvement, the Parisian chef develops a restaurant he knows well and loves: an authentic bistro, the Terroir Parisien.  Friendly, generous and raw, Terroir Parisien is All\u00e9no\u2019s idea of an easy-going restaurant where everything is dedicated to sharing great food.\n\nIts culinary concept is quite straightforward: fabulous products; original recipes from the Paris region; a simple, attractive menu, seasonal dishes and a daily board offering the freshest produces from the market.\n\nFollowing the success of the two bistros he had opened in France, the very first Terroir Parisien in Asia will open its door in Central, Hong Kong this May.  The Hong Kong\u2019s outlet will resemble the design of its French\u2019s flagship restaurants featuring a large, convivial bar that echoes an industrial and urban atmosphere with an open kitchen. At Terroir Parisien, guests will experience the authentic, perfect Parisian culinary culture. Gourmands can soon savour the bistro\u2019s signature dishes like Parisian mushroom and snails patties, Lamb stew, spring vegetables in a casserole or \u2018\u2019Nanterre\u2019\u2019 brioche French toast, vanilla ice-cream  in Hong Kong.\nBackground\nA multi-starred chef and member of the exclusive circle of the greatest chefs in the world, Yannick All\u00e9no is among the very few in history to enjoy 3 Michelin stars twice at the same time for his restaurants in Paris (All\u00e9no Paris au Pavillon Ledoyen) and Courchevel (Le 1947).\n\nBorn and raised in the Parisian suburbs, he spent his childhood in the kitchens of his family-run bistros. Promptly, cuisine became more than a passion and he spent years consolidating his skills under the best chefs. In 2006, he understood his identity as a cook was something important to develop and herald, and that is when he started to grow awareness towards the Parisian terroir, his very own land. A long and meticulous work started then, referencing all the producers, their products and the region\u2019s original recipes. In 2008, All\u00e9no initiated his culinary movement which quite naturally led to a book in 2010 to reference everything, and the opening of the first Terroir Parisien bistro in 2012, followed by a second one only a year later.

Whether in creating the thinnest automatic movement or the most expensive watch in the world, Piaget dedicates the full force of its watch and jewellery-making competence to rising to each new challenge.\n\n\"Always do better than necessary\" was the founder's motto, and the guiding principle that still prevails in the workshops of La C\u00f4te-aux-F\u00e9es where the Piaget movements are crafted, and in the Plan-les-Ouates Manufacture in Geneva where the gold cases and bracelets, often set with precious stones, are patiently fashioned.

He has worked closely with his roster of artists, some for more than 20 years, including Maurizio Cattelan and Takashi Murakami, to help realize their projects. The success of Perrotin is based on loyalty and many of the staff have worked with him for a long time, taking part in the development of the gallery in Europe, and later in Asia and the United States.\n\nPERROTIN & ASIA\n\nPerrotin has been a pioneer in forging tight relationships between the western gallery and Asian artists. In 1993, during the Yokohama contemporary art fair, NiCAF, the young Takashi Murakami was attracted to his booth and a long-term collaboration was born. They met again in New York the following year, where Perrotin showed Murakami\u2019s works at the Gramercy International Art Fair, becoming the \ufb01rst person to exhibit Murakami in the United States and outside Japan. Multiple group shows and twelve solo shows followed over the next two and a half decades at the gallery. Over the succeeding two decades, the gallery has supported and exhibited works by prominent Asian artists through a myriad of collaborative projects, whilst representing meaningful French and international artists. It has also participated in many important art fairs held throughout Asia since 1993 with NICAF Art Fair in Yokohama, Japan, such as Art Basel Hong Kong, Art Stage Jakarta, ART021 and West Bund Art & Design, Shanghai among others. Some artists of the gallery have strong links with Asia already (in their projects themselves or their venues) including Daniel Arsham, Sophie Calle, Wim Delvoye, KAWS, Jean-Michel Othoniel, and Xavier Veilhan.

We take care of the good conditions of breeding and the respect of the meat processing.\r\n\r\nThe second part of our selection is through cuts and pieces of meat. We carefully choose the most noble and refined cuts. Each piece of meat is tested and rated by our expert committee. For this evaluation, we take five criteria into consideration:\r\n- The marbling: depending on the breed, each piece of meat needs to have a specific degree of marbling in order to obtain a certification;\r\n- The texture: the meat texture needs to match its marbling level;\r\n- The flavor: natural beefy flavor is what we are looking for; \r\n- The juiciness: depending on the cooking of the meat, the juiciness is essential for evaluating the quality; \r\n- The tenderness: because tenderness depends on the level of exercise the muscle, we evaluate it differently for each cut.\r\n\r\nIt is the balance between these five criteria that will lead to the final grade of the cut and therefore, its validation. \r\n\r\nBeing the fundamentals of our brand, quality and traceability are the key words driving our activity. Indeed, through our selection process, we ensure that the quality of each of our products is in line with our requirements. Because for De La Valley excellence is not an option, we guarantee to provide you with the finest cuts of meat from the best origins. Each name and certification are controlled by the authorities in force in the country of origin. \r\n\r\nComing from certified 100% Natural farms, each of our products is vacuum packed at the origin and delivered directly to your door. There is no processing or alteration of the product in-between. In fact, we work closely with our producers to ensure the quality of packaging and compliance with production standards. \r\n\r\nThus, De La Valley guarantees the origins and the quality of its meats. Coming straight from the farm\u2019s gate to your plate, all our meats are 100% Natural Certified.", "loc": "41/F Units 04-06\nSingga Commercial Centre\nConnaught Road West\nSai Ying Pun\nHONG KONG", "year_established": null, "logo_url": "http://www.fccihk.com/sites/default/files/styles/logo_width/public/DLV_monoNoir2_0.jpg?itok=jAtNDueL", "employees": [{"first_name": "Mr Maxime", "last_name": "GRINDLER", "job_title": null, "photo_url": null}]},
